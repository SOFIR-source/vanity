## Why No API Keys? Why Fully Open Source?
Unlike other services, this project does **not** require API keys because:

- **Privacy First**: No user data is ever transmitted or stored.
- **Security**: Since all key generation is done **entirely in your browser**, there is no risk of data leaks or MITM attacks.
- **Transparency**: Being fully **open source**, anyone can audit the code and verify there are no hidden risks.
- **No Dependencies on Centralized Services**: This tool does not rely on external APIs, reducing the risk of downtime, rate limits, or censorship.
